# Sales-Data-Project-2

📊 Sales Data Analysis Project (Google Sheets, SQL, Python)
Welcome to my second portfolio project! This one highlights my growing skills in Google Sheets, SQL, and Python, focusing on analyzing and visualizing a sales dataset. This project showcases my journey in data cleaning, querying, and visualization.

# 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:

Organize and clean raw sales data in Google Sheets (or Excel).

Query and summarize data using SQL (via SQLite).

Visualize key insights with Python (using pandas and matplotlib).

It’s designed as a foundation for more advanced dashboards and analytics, showing how different tools can work together.

# 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Google Sheets/Excel: Data cleaning, initial exploration, and formatting.

SQLite: SQL queries for sorting, filtering, and summarizing sales data.

Python 3.x: Data analysis and visualization using:

sqlite3

pandas

matplotlib

# 📁 Files Included
sales_data_sample.xlsx: The raw sales dataset.

sql_queries.sql: SQL scripts for analyzing sales data.

sales_analysis.py: Python script for dynamic analysis and visualization.

SQL_to_Python_Example.png: Screenshot showing SQL-to-Python output.

# 📊 Visual Output
The final output includes:

Dynamic bar charts summarizing key sales metrics.

Data flows from Google Sheets → SQL → Python.

Explorations of sales by region, product, and date.

# 💡 Lessons Learned
Clean, consistent data formatting is essential for analysis.

Managing file paths ensures smooth integration between tools.

Google Sheets offers flexibility, but SQL provides stronger querying capabilities.

Python visualization ties everything together into a cohesive story.

# 📌 Next Steps
Develop interactive dashboards (Tableau, Streamlit, or Dash).

Implement advanced SQL features like joins and subqueries.

Expand the Python visualizations to include trends, comparisons, and forecasts.

# 🤝 Open to Feedback
This project is a stepping stone in my data analysis journey. Clone it, fork it, critique it—your insights are always welcome!

“Keep growing, learning, and sharing—one project at a time.”
